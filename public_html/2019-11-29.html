<h1>November 29, 2019</h1>
<p>Adding some work to the content management system I created yesterday. It's very basic, but I couldn't find anything text-based that was simple enough to use. Day One started charging alot of money for their journaling software. Everything on iOS is out to make money. It's starts off as free then once they have enough users they start charging customers. That's how it was with Insight Timer. I used to love that app. Then they started charging even for the individual sounds.</p>
<p>See me dancing with the MLA?</p>
<p>See me dancing with the M.L.A?</p>
<p>Perhaps, it is a tightrope.</p>
